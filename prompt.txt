### **Prompt: Generate a Realistic Airline Booking Dataset with Individual Customer Histories, Economic Trends, and Major Global Events (2014-2025)**  

"Generate a synthetic **airline booking dataset** with **1,000 unique passengers** over **10 years (2014-2025)**. The dataset should incorporate **real-world economic conditions, business cycles, geopolitical events, global holidays, and major events** that influence airline ticket pricing and travel demand. Each passenger should have a unique **PassengerID** and multiple records reflecting their booking history.  

### **1. Passenger and Booking Data:**
- **Total Records:** **11,740 flight bookings**, distributed among **1,000 unique passengers**.
- **Flight Capacity:** Each flight has **200 seats**, consisting of:  
  - **Business Travelers:** 60 per flight (frequent flyers, high ancillary spending).  
  - **Leisure Travelers:** 140 per flight (seasonal, varied purchasing behavior).  
- **Unique Identifiers:**  
  - `PassengerID`: A unique identifier for each passenger.  
  - `Customer_History_ID`: A unique ID linking multiple bookings to the same passenger.

|------------------------|---------------------|
| **WiFi**              | 10 - 30             |
| **Lounge Access**     | 25 - 50             |

  - Prices increase during peak seasons and major global events.  
  - Business travelers have a higher chance of purchasing premium services (WiFi, Lounge Access, Priority Boarding).  
  - Leisure travelers are more likely to buy Meals and Insurance.  

### **4. Data Output Format:**

- `Customer_History_ID` (**Groups multiple bookings of the same traveler**)  
- `Ticket_Booking_Date`  
- `Flight_Date`  
- `Days_Before_Travel` (Number of days between booking and flight)  
- `Traveler_Type` (Business/Leisure)

  - **Leisure Travelers** book well in advance.
